## üéØ Individual Agent Analysis

### **CoverageTypeAgent**

#### **üéØ Purpose**
Detects pharmacies with suspicious coverage patterns, specifically focusing on claims that are "Cash" or "Not Covered" and unusual OCC (Other Coverage Code) patterns.

#### **üìä Columns Used**
```python
Primary Columns:
- pharmacy_number: Unique pharmacy identifier
- coverage_type: Type of coverage (Cash, Not Covered, Well Covered, etc.)
- occ: Other Coverage Code (0, 1, 3 are red flags)
- pharmacy_name, pharmacy_city, pharmacy_state: Location data

Supporting Columns:
- All pharmacy identification fields for context
```

#### **üîç Preprocessing Approach**
1. **Data Validation**: Check for null values in key columns
2. **Coverage Type Standardization**: Normalize coverage_type strings
3. **OCC Code Analysis**: Identify suspicious OCC codes (0, 1, 3)
4. **Pharmacy Grouping**: Group by pharmacy_number for analysis

#### **üß† Detection Logic**
```python
For each pharmacy:
1. Count total claims
2. Flag claims where:
   - coverage_type in ["Not Covered", "Cash"] OR
   - occ in [0, 1, 3]
3. Calculate flagged_percent = (flagged_claims / total_claims) * 100
4. Assign fraud_score based on percentage:
   - >90%: 1.0 (HIGH_RISK)
   - >75%: 0.8 (MEDIUM_HIGH)
   - >50%: 0.6 (MEDIUM)
   - >25%: 0.3 (LOW_MEDIUM)
   - >0%: 0.1 (LOW)
```

#### **üí° Why This Approach**
- **Coverage Patterns**: Cash/Not Covered claims often indicate fraud attempts
- **OCC Codes**: Specific codes (0,1,3) are industry red flags
- **Percentage Threshold**: >90% threshold catches systematic fraud
- **Pharmacy-Level Analysis**: Focuses on pharmacy behavior patterns

#### **üìà Current Performance**
- **Findings**: 108 pharmacies analyzed
- **High Risk**: 82 pharmacies with >90% flagged claims
- **Average Score**: 0.806 (highest among all agents)

### **PatientFlipAgentEnhanced**

#### **üéØ Purpose**
Detects "insurance-to-cash flip" fraud patterns where patients initially submit insurance claims, get rejected, then switch to cash payments for the same medication.

#### **üìä Columns Used**
```python
Primary Columns:
- patient_id: Unique patient identifier
- product_ndc: National Drug Code
- pharmacy_number: Pharmacy identifier
- coverage_type: Insurance vs Cash claims
- date_submitted: Chronological ordering
- pharmacy_name, pharmacy_city, pharmacy_state: Location data

Rejection Indicators:
- pa_rejection_code_1, pa_rejection_code_2: Prior authorization rejections
- latest_pa_status_desc: Status descriptions
- claim_cob_primary_reject_code1, claim_cob_primary_reject_code2: Claim rejections
- copay_cost: High copay amounts (>$100)
```

#### **üîç Preprocessing Approach**
1. **Coverage Type Filtering**: Focus on relevant types ["Cash", "Not Covered", "Well Covered", "Covered - HD"]
2. **Chronological Sorting**: Sort by date_submitted for temporal analysis
3. **Patient-Product-Pharmacy Grouping**: Group by (patient_id, product_ndc, pharmacy_number)
4. **Rejection Pattern Analysis**: Identify rejection indicators in early claims

#### **üß† Detection Logic**
```python
For each patient-product-pharmacy group:
1. Separate insurance claims (Well Covered, Covered - HD) from cash claims (Cash, Not Covered)
2. Check if cash claims come AFTER insurance claims (temporal flip)
3. Verify rejection indicators in insurance claims:
   - Non-empty rejection codes
   - "reject/denied/failed" in status descriptions
   - High copay costs (>$100)
4. Calculate flip_ratio = cash_claims / total_claims
5. Assign fraud_score based on flip_ratio:
   - >80%: 1.0 (HIGH_RISK)
   - >60%: 0.8 (MEDIUM_HIGH)
   - >40%: 0.6 (MEDIUM)
   - >20%: 0.4 (LOW_MEDIUM)
   - >0%: 0.2 (LOW)
```

#### **üí° Why This Approach**
- **Temporal Analysis**: Insurance-to-cash sequence indicates fraud
- **Rejection Validation**: Ensures legitimate rejection before flip
- **Product Consistency**: Same medication across insurance and cash
- **Pharmacy Consistency**: Same pharmacy for both claim types
- **Adapted to Real Data**: Uses actual coverage types found in data

#### **üìà Current Performance**
- **Findings**: 21 flip patterns detected
- **High Risk**: 1 pharmacy with systematic flip patterns
- **Average Score**: 0.371 (moderate risk detection)

```

#### **üîç Preprocessing Approach**
1. **Threshold Filtering**: Focus on claims above thresholds:
   - copay_cost > $200
   - oop_cost > $500
   - copay_fee_cost > $200
   - original_cost > $1000
2. **Pharmacy Grouping**: Group high-dollar claims by pharmacy

   - avg_cost: Average claim cost
   - cash_percentage: % of cash/not covered claims
2. Assign fraud_score based on multiple factors:
   - Claim volume: +0.25 for ‚â•10 claims, +0.15 for ‚â•5 claims
   - Total cost: +0.25 for ‚â•$10K, +0.15 for ‚â•$5K
   - Average cost: +0.25 for ‚â•$1K, +0.15 for ‚â•$500
   - Cash percentage: +0.25 for ‚â•80%, +0.15 for ‚â•60%
3. Maximum score: 1.0
```

#### **üí° Why This Approach**

   - pa_rejections: pa_rejection_code_1/2
   - status_rejections: "reject/denied/failed" in latest_pa_status_desc
2. Calculate metrics:
   - total_claims: Total claims for pharmacy
   - rejected_claims: Claims with any rejection indicator
   - rejection_percentage: (rejected_claims / total_claims) * 100
3. Assign fraud_score based on:
   - Rejection percentage: +0.4 for ‚â•50%, +0.3 for ‚â•30%, +0.2 for ‚â•20%
   - Rejection volume: +0.3 for ‚â•20 rejections, +0.2 for ‚â•10, +0.1 for ‚â•5
   - Total volume: +0.3 for ‚â•50 claims, +0.2 for ‚â•20, +0.1 for ‚â•10
```

#### **üí° Why This Approach**
- **Multiple Rejection Types**: Captures different fraud patterns
